- User interface: 80%

## Mock Infrastructure

### Chrome Extension APIs

- Complete Chrome storage (sync/local) simulation
- Runtime message passing and lifecycle events
- Tabs API with language detection
- Alarms for scheduled exercises
- Notifications for user alerts
- IndexedDB with realistic data persistence

### Translation Services

- Chrome Translation API simulation
- Multiple language pair support
- Error condition simulation
- Network timeout handling
- Quota limit testing

### User Interface

- JSDOM for DOM manipulation testing
- Event simulation (mouse, keyboard, touch)
- CSS and layout testing
- Responsive design validation
- Accessibility compliance checks

## Running Tests

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run all tests
npm test

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Debug specific tests
npm run test:debug -- tests/unit/database.service.test.js
```

### End-to-End Testing

```bash
# Run E2E tests (requires Chrome)
npm run test:e2e
```

Note: E2E tests will launch Chrome with the extension loaded for realistic testing.

### Continuous Integration

Tests run automatically on:

- Pull requests
- Main branch commits
- Release tag creation

## Test Architecture

### Test Organization

```
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ setup.js              # Global test configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ chrome-mock.js         # Chrome API mocking
â”œâ”€â”€ unit/                  # Isolated component tests
â”œâ”€â”€ integration/           # UI component interactions
â””â”€â”€ e2e/                  # Complete user workflows
```

### Key Testing Utilities

- **Custom Matchers**: Vocabulary validation, language code validation
- **Mock Factories**: Realistic test data generation
- **Async Helpers**: Promise resolution, timing utilities
- **DOM Simulation**: JSDOM with Chrome extension context

## Debugging Tests

### Jest Debugging

```bash
# Debug with Node.js inspector
npm run test:debug

# Run specific test file
npm test -- database.service.test.js

# Run tests matching pattern
npm test -- --grep "translation"
```

### Puppeteer Debugging (E2E)

Set `headless: false` in E2E tests to see browser interactions.

### Common Issues

1. **Extension Loading**: Ensure manifest.json is valid
2. **Async Timing**: Use proper async/await patterns
3. **Mock Cleanup**: Tests should be independent
4. **Chrome APIs**: Verify mock implementations match real APIs

## Contributing to Tests

### Adding New Tests

1. Follow existing test structure and naming
2. Include both happy path and error scenarios
3. Mock external dependencies appropriately
4. Ensure tests are fast and reliable
5. Document complex test scenarios

### Test Requirements

- All new features must include comprehensive tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
- UI changes require integration tests
- API changes need updated mocks

For detailed testing documentation, see `/tests/README.md`.
