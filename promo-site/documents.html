                    <h3>1. Instant Translation</h3>
                    <p>Getting a translation is effortless. Simply use your mouse to highlight any word or piece of text
                        on a webpage. As soon as you release the mouse button, a small, non-intrusive popup will appear,
                        showing the translation in your preferred language.</p>

                    <h3>2. Saving Words to Your Vocabulary</h3>
                    <p>When you translate a word or phrase you want to remember, click the "Save" or bookmark icon
                        within the translation popup. This action adds the term and its translation to your personal
                        vocabulary list, which you can access anytime from the extension's main panel.</p>

                    <p>To truly learn your saved words, navigate to the "Practice" or "SRS" tab in the extension. Our
                        Spaced Repetition System will present you with flashcards at optimal intervals, helping you
                        commit words to your long-term memory. The more you practice, the smarter the algorithm gets.

                        You can track how many words you've saved, your practice consistency, and your overall progress
                        over time. This feedback helps you stay motivated and focused on your goals.</p>
